        question: "Can the refugee citizens of Ukraine enter the Romanian teritory, even though they are not citizens of the European Union?",
        answer: "Yes, as a result of the introduction by the European Commission of the temporary protection mechanism for refugees from Ukraine, also applicable in Romania. The duration of the temporary protection is one year, this duration can be extended by periods of 6 months, for a maximum of one year. If the reasons for temporary protection persist, Romania may send to the European Commission a proposal to the Council of the European Union to extend the temporary protection by up to one year."

        question: "What does the introduction of the temporary protection mechanism entail?",

    {
        question: "How long can I stay in Romania?",
        answer: "Citizens who legally enter the territory of Romania in Ukraine benefit from a period of legal stay of 90 days. Ukrainian citizens who have legally entered the territory of Romania and who do not request a form of protection can be employed without a work permit. These persons may apply for an extension of the right of residence for work purposes for successive periods of 1 year, provided that the conditions which were the basis for granting the initial right of residence are maintained."

        answer: "Romania can provide nationally about 400,000 accommodation places for refugees from Ukraine. They can be accommodated both in the spaces provided by the state, and in units or private individuals who have expressed their willingness to offer accommodation. The related expenses, including for food, are provided from the funds allocated for this purpose from the state budget, as well as from donations. Also, other types of resources will be provided - food, hygiene products and clothing - collected through the online platform created by the Romanian Government, through other structures and private initiatives."
